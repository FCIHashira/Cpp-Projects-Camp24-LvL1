##### Tic Tac Toe

#Details

| Duration        | 15 Days |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Submit deadline | 15 Oct  |

You are asked to build a a program that plays Tic Tac Teo with the user.

You are required to draw the grid in the terminal, and ask user for movement then update the grid after make letting the computer plays it turns. And if anyone won, you end the game and show the results and the final grid.

**üö®NOTEs**: 
- For Computer movement, you have the flexibility to do it in any method, starting from most simple and basic ways, to the most complex ways using What is called: [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) and [Tic Tac Toe Game Theory](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2015/10/21/game-theory-in-tic-tac-toe/).
	I Prefer that if you have time to search and try to understand one of them, and if you could apply it in your project, go ahead!‚öîÔ∏èüî•
	
- It is important to split your project into functions to easy scale it in the next versions. Also learning [Header files](https://youtu.be/0TCh01BBlrM?si=j5Baug1MyBhRo4zj) are important to help you organize your project in better ways.

- It is better to design the logic on paper or any Diagram application so it makes everything easy to build in future. And its important to read and understand all versions so you can imagine how you'll build everything and organize it.

- If you finished building first 3 versions, submit, then if you want you can build the other last 3.
