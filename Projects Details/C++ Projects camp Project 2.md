##### File Encrypter / Decrypter

#Details

| Duration        | 6 Days |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Submit deadline | 13 Sep |

You are asked to build a program that has the same basic idea of ransomwares. 
Your task is to build a program that encrypts or decrypt files passed by the user using [Caesar Cipher algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) or any more complex bit-encryption algorithms.

You are required to do this task using *Caesar Cipher*, but if you would like to use another more complex algorithm, go ahead!‚öîÔ∏èüî•

**üö®NOTEs**: 
- You are encrypting the file binary code, NOT the content, so you can encrypt not only text files, but any file as images are not text but binary code.
- You can use [HxD program]([https://youtu.be/k8MHJhAFPms?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/k8MHJhAFPms?feature=shared "https://youtu.be/k8MHJhAFPms?feature=shared") to see the file content, binary code, hexadecimal code... before and after encryption.

#Tasks
- Build 2 versions, v1 and v2
#### Version 1
- [ ] User should specify the path of the targeted file.
- [ ] User should decide if he wants to encrypt or decrypt the file.
- [ ] Do the encrypt or decrypt operations.
- [ ] After finishing, show success message.
- [ ] Tag this version (v1.0.0)

#### Version 2
- [ ] Instead of asking user if he want to encrypt of decrypt the file, think of another way that will allow you to know if the file is already encrypted or not.
- [ ] If the file is already encrypted, decrypt it.
- [ ] If the file is not encrypted, encrypt it.
- [ ] After finishing, show success message, **and** print the name of the operation you have made on the file (Encryption/Decryption)
- [ ] Tag this version (v2.0.0)

**üö®NOTEs:** version 2 requires a lot of *brainstorming*, *searching*, *creativity* and *cooperation*, and their are many creative ways to check if you have encrypted this file before or not.
**SO**, to make things easier
- We suggest to you to use ***HxD*** to see how binary code changes. 
- Search and think a lot.
- cooperate with your camp mates.
- Start building this project from the first day not before the deadline!

--------

#Conditions-Of-Acceptance
- Do Clean Code.
- Use C++ / C.
- Create the 2 versions with the same tasks mentioned above, and upload all the 2 versions to the same repository on github.
- Last commit of each version should be tagged by the version name.
- Submit before the deadline.
- The Repository should be on your own github account and **public** not private
- AI Generated codes are **NOT** allowed (**Cause you kicked out the camp**)
##### Finally 
The Hashira Corps is waiting for you to join us, so do your best and try as much hard as you can, search and think, imagine and build, and we are excited to see you becoming a Hashira!‚öîÔ∏è
Do **NOT** hesitate to ask for help if you are stuck, and if you can help others, do it.

This is the way to become #The_Next_Hashira ‚öîÔ∏è
