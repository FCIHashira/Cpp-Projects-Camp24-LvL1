### Motivation
We have noticed that many of 1st year graduated students in FCI have common problems:
- Most of them used to build small tasks, but not to larger scaled tasks. like tasks that contains many subtasks.
- Most of them didn't get used in using Git & Github.
- Most of them lack the skill of analyzing the idea, planning it, and then turning it into a program.
- And finally, most of them have common belive that C-Family was exits only for low-level study, and they don't build real projects.

### Goals
We decided to launch a camp that focus on solving these problems.

### Requirements
- This camp is begginer friendly, doesn't require any knowledge in c++ or C.
- It requires knowledge in programming and prefer to have knowledge in C.
